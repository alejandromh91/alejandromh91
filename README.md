Wow, what a great idea!

- 👋 Hi, I’m @alejandromh91
- 👀 I’m interested in climbing, roleplaying games, cooking and, unexpectedly, programming!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java, especially spring boot web services. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that mixes this with my hobbies
- 📫 How to reach me is on the way to a mountain :P

Right now I'm trying to implement an eclipse plugin for github copilot...
